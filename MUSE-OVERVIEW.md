**🔒 MUSE — Overview + MUSE 0–3 (Canonical v1)**

***MUSE** is a resilient, design-first, English-first system.*

* **Movements**: **DREAM · LIVE · ADAPT** — three continuous, interlocking loops.
* **Flow**:
	* **DREAM** — Specify intent and render it into executable form.
	* **LIVE** — Execute the system and observe real behavior, including UX.
	* **ADAPT** — Interpret evidence and evolve the specification.
* **Principles**:
	* Design is an **executable conversation**.
	* Form emerges from **constraints**, not control.
	* **Behavior is the signal**.
	* Change stays **small, reversible, and humane**.
* **Authority**:	
	* Humans own **intent**.
	* Machines synchronize **structure**.
	* Reality—including people—**decides**.
* **Result**: Living systems that improve continuously without sacrificing stability, clarity, or creative momentum.

## **MUSE 0: Flow — V1**

```
[ 1 DREAM ]   Specify → Render   — Are we clear on intent?
[ 2 LIVE  ]   Execute → Observe  — What is actually happening?
[ 3 ADAPT ]   Interpret → Evolve — What should we change next?

*MUSE does not create inspiration.
It removes everything that suppresses it.*

When humans do 100% of the work,
only scraps remain for what they do best:
**creative problem-solving and invention.**

---

## **M1 — DREAM**

*Say what must become true.*

### **Step 1.1 — Specify**

Humans express:

* intent
* behavior
* constraints
* non-goals

Language is natural (Markdown / BDD).
Nothing is optimized yet.
Nothing is assumed.

The output of this step is **clarity**, not code.

---

### **Step 1.2 — Render**

*Make the spec executable.*

* AI synchronizes meaning → structure
* Formal artifacts are generated:

  * code
  * tests
  * diagrams
  * docs
* Architecture is proposed and explicitly approved
* Everything is a **current render**, not truth

The output of this step is **something real to observe**.

---

## **M2 — LIVE**

*Listen to reality as it is lived.*

### **Step 2.1 — Execute**

*Release the system into the world.*

* The system runs
* People use it
* Contexts collide
* Meaning meets reality

This step is intentionally boring.
Nothing is “learned” yet.

---

### **Step 2.2 — Observe**

*Listen without judgment.*

* Observe system behavior
* Observe human interaction (**UX signals**)
* Capture:

  * failures
  * friction
  * misuse
  * success
  * surprise

No fixes.
No optimization.
No reaction.

The output of this step is **evidence**.

---

## **M3 — ADAPT**

*Change deliberately.*

### **Step 3.1 — Interpret**

*Turn evidence into understanding.*

* Humans review observations
* Patterns are discussed
* Gaps in logic and intent surface
* Assumptions are challenged

This is where design thinking lives.

---

### **Step 3.2 — Evolve**

*Restate intent, not artifacts.*

* Update the spec first
* Clarify intent
* Refine constraints
* Adjust behavior
* Let code follow

Changes are:

* small
* local
* reversible

The output of this step is **a better spec**.
