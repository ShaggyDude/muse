# Muse Design System

Welcome to the **Muse Design System** documentation! This living design system embodies the Muse methodology for joyful software creation.

## What is Muse?

Muse is a comprehensive methodology that emphasizes:

- **Human-Centered Design First**: Start with full user journeys, not isolated tasks
- **Physics of Flow**: Work flows "just in time" with no handoff friction  
- **Context-Native Components**: Built directly in their live data environments
- **Real Data Over Mock Data**: Edge cases are discovered during development

## Quick Start

Explore our component library with auto-generated variants and live code examples:

- [Button Components](/components/button)
- [Card Components](/components/card)
- [Form Components](/components/forms)

## Design System Architecture

Our design system follows a three-tier component architecture:

### 🔹 Atoms → `/components/ui`
Pure presentation components with no business logic - buttons, inputs, icons, etc.

### 🔸 Features → `/components/features`  
Domain-aware components that implement flows or page-specific functionality.

### 🟦 Layouts → `/app/layout.tsx`
Structural containers for pages using CSS Grid.

## BDD-Driven Development

Every component is mapped to `.feature` files that define:
- User acceptance criteria
- Edge case handling
- Accessibility requirements
- Visual regression testing

## Get Started

```bash
pnpm add @repo/ui
```

```tsx
import { Button } from '@repo/ui'

export default function App() {
  return <Button variant="default">Get Started</Button>
}
```
