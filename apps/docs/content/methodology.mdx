# Muse: A Manifesto for Joyful Creation

*The Joy Has Been Lost from The Creative Process*

## 🌿 Process Stages Overview

Muse flows through seven **iterative stages**, grouped into three main **phases**. **Design and Development operate in parallel**, with each stage continuously informing the others.

| Phase        | Stage | Name                                     | Purpose      |
| ------------ | ----- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| **Prep**             | 1     | Communication, Tracking & Data Discovery | Establish async workflows and investigate real data conditions.                      |
| **Design ↔ Develop** | 2     | Ideation & Lo-Fi Exploration             | Rapid, low-cost idea exploration. Sketches (even Markdown-powered) live here.        |
|                      | 3     | Self-Validating Specifications           | BDD feature specs that define user journeys and auto-generate test scaffolding.      |
|                      | 4     | Direct Development with Real Data        | Build components in-context with real data and edge cases from day one.              |
|                      | 5     | Core Tech Stack & Feedback               | Shared monorepo tools, data layer, runtime, and real-time stakeholder feedback.      |
| **Launch & Learn**   | 6     | Release Cadence                          | Lightweight, continuous flow of deployment and prioritization.                       |
|                      | 7     | Monitoring, Observability & Impact       | Data-driven feedback loop to validate feature success and improve future iterations. |

Each stage is iterative — teams are encouraged to revisit, refine, and loop back as new insights emerge.

## 🧠 Key Philosophy Shifts

- **Human-Centered Design First:** Start with full user journeys, not isolated tasks.
- **Physics of Flow:** Work flows "just in time" with no handoff friction.
- **Context-Native Components:** Built directly in their live data environments.
- **Evolutionary BDD:** Self-validating specs that evolve with usage patterns.
- **Real Data Over Mock Data:** Edge cases are discovered during development.
- **Dual Track Async Design/Dev:** Design informs dev at natural points—not forced checkpoints.
- **Process-as-a-Product:** The methodology itself is subject to feedback and evolution.
- **Event-Driven Documentation:** ADRs captured when decisions happen, not scheduled meetings.
- **AI-Aided Design Sprints:** Compressed into hours not weeks, aided by human-curated AI.
- **Minimal Viable Documentation:** Document where it provides the most value.
- **User-Controlled UI:** Respect system preferences (e.g., dark mode, prefers-reduced-motion) and avoid anti-features like theme toggles.
- **Async-Meeting Culture:** Replace time-wasting meetings with purposeful, async communication and focused collaboration.
- **Lean Operations, Rich Creation:** We aggressively favor free-tier and open-source tools. Money should be spent on what directly creates user value, not on operational overhead.

## The 4.5-Day Work Week Structure

**Week A (Full Week):**
```
Monday:    9 hours (deep work day)
Tuesday:   9 hours (collaboration day)  
Wednesday: 9 hours (development day)
Thursday:  9 hours (review/feedback day)
Friday:    9 hours (planning/cleanup)
```

**Week B (Long Weekend):**
```
Monday:    9 hours (deep work day)
Tuesday:   9 hours (collaboration day)
Wednesday: 9 hours (development day)  
Thursday:  9 hours (review/feedback day)
Friday:    OFF
```

**Total:** 40.5 hours per week average across the year (50 work weeks)

### Benefits

- **3-day weekends every other week** for creative rest and personal time
- **Predictable rhythm** that teams can plan around
- **Focused work blocks** that reduce context switching
- **Built-in rest** that research shows is essential for creative work

## Component Architecture in Practice

Our design system implements the Muse philosophy through a three-tier architecture:

### 🔹 Atoms → `/components/ui`
**Purpose:** Reusable building blocks. Pure presentation.
- No business/domain knowledge
- No layout assumptions  
- Just props in → UI out
- Fully covered by the design system

### 🔸 Features → `/components/features`  
**Purpose:** Domain-aware components that implement flows or page-specific functionality
- Composes multiple atoms
- Can contain logic (e.g., fetch, validation)
- Bound to business domain or app feature
- Mapped directly to .feature files

### 🟦 Layouts → `/app/layout.tsx`
**Purpose:** Structural container for pages
- Defines grid-template-areas and placement
- Rarely needs logic
- Controls flow/responsiveness

## BDD-Driven Development

Every component follows the BDD specification format:

```gherkin
Feature: User onboarding flow

  Scenario: New user completes signup
    Given a visitor is on the homepage
    When they click "Get Started"
    And they fill out the registration form
    Then they should see a welcome screen
```

### Spec Confidence Levels

**High Confidence Specs:**
- Based on validated user research or established patterns
- Clear success metrics defined
- Comprehensive test coverage required

**Medium Confidence Specs:**
- Reasonable assumptions based on similar features
- Basic success metrics defined
- Standard test coverage

**Low Confidence Specs:**
- Experimental features or new problem domains
- Hypothesis-driven metrics
- Lightweight test coverage initially

## Real Data Philosophy

Instead of developing components in isolation with mock data, we build them **directly in the Next.js application context**, using real schemas and live or seeded data.

```tsx
// ❌ Don't: Mock data
const mockUser = { name: 'John Doe', email: 'john@example.com' }

// ✅ Do: Real data with edge cases
const user = await prisma.user.findFirst({ 
  where: { email: "demo@example.com" } 
});

// Handle edge cases naturally
return (
  <UserCard user={user}>
    <h2>{user?.name ?? "Unnamed User"}</h2>
    <p>{user?.email}</p>
  </UserCard>
);
```

## Async-Meeting Culture

### Communication Cadence

**Daily: Async Standups**
- Written updates via Slack/Discord/GitHub 
- No synchronous meetings required
- AI bot assists with note-taking and ticket creation

**Weekly: Encouragement & Alignment**
- 30-minute team check-in focused on morale and high-level direction
- Not a status meeting—more like "how are we feeling about this work?"

**Bi-weekly: Stakeholder Previews**
- Share Vercel preview links with light commentary
- Stakeholders provide feedback asynchronously

**Monthly: Strategic Alignment**
- Leadership reviews overall direction and priorities
- Adjust course based on monitoring data

## AI-Assisted Workflows

An AI bot monitors team communications and provides intelligent assistance:

**Proactive Suggestions:**
- "Should I create a ticket for that feature request?"
- "This sounds like it might affect the user onboarding spec—want me to flag it?"
- "I noticed this technical discussion might warrant an ADR"

**Automatic Note-Taking:**
- Summarizes ad-hoc technical discussions
- Extracts action items and decisions
- Links conversations to relevant GitHub issues or specs
