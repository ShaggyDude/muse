## BDD Specification

```gherkin
Feature: Card Component
  As a user viewing content
  I want information to be organized in clear containers
  So that I can easily scan and understand the content

  Scenario: Card displays content
    Given a card with content "Hello World"
    When I view the card
    Then I should see the content "Hello World"
    And the content should be contained within a card border

  Scenario: Card with custom styling
    Given a card with additional CSS classes
    When I view the card
    Then the custom styles should be applied
    And the card should maintain its basic structure
